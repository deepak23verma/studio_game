This game is the result of the Pragmatic Studio Ruby tutorial. The game is 
designed to read in any number of players from a csv file with a starting
health value (default is 100) then go on a multiple round treasure hunt to
accumulate points. The number of rounds are defined by the user. The final
high scores out sorted in descending order and outputted to the terminal and
a csv file called high_scores.csv
